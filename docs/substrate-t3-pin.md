| Required pin SHA | `c1f224d9380e908e02578858b86f04abd7b386d8` (`c1f224d9`) |
| Recorded by | Parent repository `vendor/t3code` gitlink |
| Vendor strategy | Non-recursive Git submodule; `bun run prepare:t3-runtime` validates the gitlink and builds the pinned server |

Update this file whenever the shadow-server pin moves. Keep the Electron runtime
constant and parent gitlink synchronized. Generated contract banners record the
revision they were generated from and change only when contracts are regenerated.
